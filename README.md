## üíª Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
```
Core:
- Python 3.8+
- zxcvbn (optional, for enhanced analysis)
- tkinter/customtkinter (for GUI)

Optional:
- watchdog (for auto-reload development)
- nltk (for future NLP enhancements)
```

### Key Algorithms

#### 1. Enhanced Entropy Calculation
```
Total Entropy = Base Entropy + Frequency Entropy - Pattern Penalties
Base Entropy = length √ó log‚ÇÇ(character_pool)
Frequency Entropy = -Œ£(p √ó log‚ÇÇ(p)) for each unique character
Pattern Penalties = keyboard_walk(-10) + repetition(-10) + sequential(-10)
```

#### 2. Strength Scoring
```
Score = Length_Points + Diversity_Points + Entropy_Bonus - Penalties
90-100: Very Strong    | 60-80: Strong
40-60: Moderate        | 20-40: Weak
0-20: Very Weak
```

#### 3. Pattern Detection
- Keyboard walks checked against 11 common QWERTY patterns
- Repetition identified through regex: `(.)\1{2,}`
- Sequences verified across 3 character classes (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
